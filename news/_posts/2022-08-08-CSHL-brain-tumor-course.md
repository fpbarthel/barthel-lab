Thanks to the invitation of [Dr. Sadhan Majumder](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/sadhan_majumder.html) I had the opportunity to teach at this year's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Brain Tumor course. The students and faculty were outstanding: everyone was fully engaged and embracing every opportunity to learn new things.
