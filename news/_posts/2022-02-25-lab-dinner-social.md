The spring weather in Phoenix has been incredible. Had the chance to take the lab and friends out for dinner at Pemberton, which is a hip food truck venue just a few minutes walking from the lab. Great times. Need to start taking photos more often though, because I missed out on documenting several other of these fun social events we had!
