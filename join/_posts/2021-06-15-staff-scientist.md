The Barthel laboratory is focused on unraveling the role of telomere dysfunction in glioma development and evolution. We employ computational biology, evolutionary genetics, functional genomics, and molecular biology to map the ramifications of dysfunctional telomeres on glioma genomes. We are looking for a talented, passionate, and highly motivated scientist to manage the wet lab activities of our group.

### Position Summary
The scientist will carry out research in a molecular laboratory. Research may encompass hypothesis- or discovery-driven approaches to make genomic discoveries that may be translated to improve patient care and outcomes. Responsibilities include:
- Perform wet lab experiments and participate in experimental design. Perform research on existing methods and introduce/optimize/troubleshoot new assays into the laboratoryâ€™s repertoire
- Collaborate with other researchers inside and outside of our group to accelerate research
- Provide support for grant submissions (e.g. generation of preliminary data, writing support)
- Assisting research administration to ensure compliance with institutional review boards
- Work with research administration to develop material transfer agreements with our partners
- Prepare and manage individual projects and program budgets
- Participate in project management within program, including report generation, communicating with collaborators, and ensuring final tasks are complete and deliverables are delivered on time
- Responsible for overall operations of labs within programs, including space management, equipment management and supply management. Responsible for assigning and maintaining research notebooks
- Supervise and/or mentor laboratory staff

### Education and Preferred Qualifications
The ideal candidate will have a track record of peer reviewed publications in molecular and cellular biology and ideally have a few years of postdoctoral experience working in a molecular biology laboratory. The candidate is familiar with cancer biology. Essential bench skills include tissue preparation, cell culture, genetic engineering, sequencing library preparation, confocal and widefield microscopy. Priority is given to candidates with a Ph.D. in molecular or cellular biology but candidates from all backgrounds will be considered.

### Location
We are located at the Translational Genomics Institute (TGen) set to the backdrop of the stunning Sonoran Desert. The successful candidate will be a part of the Cancer and Cell Biology Division at TGen and will have numerous opportunities to work with our partners around the globe.
