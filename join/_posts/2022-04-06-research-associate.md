The Barthel Laboratory is a cancer genomics lab focused on utilizing state-of-the-art genomic approaches to study the development and evolution of glial brain tumors (gliomas). The lab has a particular interest in the fundamental role of telomere dysfunction in glioma development, but is generally interested in all aspects of tumor evolution including but not limited to longitudinal studies of therapy response assessed by genomic analyses of tissue samples and liquid biopsies. We are looking for a talented, passionate and highly motivated individual to enrich our team and support the wet lab activities in the lab.

### Position Summary

The research associate will carry out experiments in a molecular biology laboratory. Research may encompass hypothesis- or discovery-driven approaches to make genomic discoveries that may be translated to improve patient care and outcomes. Responsibilities include:
- Participate in experimental design, interpreting test results, drawing conclusions, and finding solutions to problems utilizing detailed knowledge of research laboratory procedures and practices
- Independently execute molecular biology protocols, specifically various NGS-based library preparation protocols, using established molecular biology techniques and new solutions
- Maintain cell lines in culture and actively participate in molecular cloning experiments
- Keep detailed logs of the experiments and report scientific findings through reports at lab meetings 
- Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for routine protocols in the lab
- Sample preparation and processing using established and new protocols
- Organization of samples, equipment and reagents in the lab under supervision of the lab manager
- Work closely with postdocs, graduate students and other research staff to ensure that tasks are complete and deliverables are delivered on time


### Requirements
The ideal candidate possesses a bachelor's degree in a science-related field (Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Genetics) with at least one year of experience in a biological sciences research laboratory. They have experience with basic laboratory equipment (i.e. thermal cyclers, microscopes, centrifuges) and an understanding of laboratory techniques including PCR, sequencing, real-time PCR, tissue culture and gel electrophoresis. Importantly, they are adept communicators and demonstrate strong interpersonal skills.

### Location
We are located at the Translational Genomics Institute (TGen), a non-profit research institute located in Phoenix, Arizona that is set to the backdrop of the stunning Sonoran Desert. Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the nation, the fastest growing for 5 years in a row and ranked 5th in the Nation as an Emerging Life Science Market. Phoenix's unprecedented growth in the life sciences is fueled by over $3.25 billion in capital investment which has led to over 5 million square feet of new bioscience healthcare facilities constructed since 2019. At the heart of this growth is a 30-acre urban life sciences center - the Phoenix Biomedical Campus (PBC), at which TGen sits at the center.
Phoenix additionally boasts an incredibly comfortable lifestyle averaging over 300 sunny days a year, multiple mountain ranges in near proximity and some of the most magnificent national and state parks in the nation within driving range. The airport is ranked as one of the best in the country in terms of passenger satisfaction owing to fast moving lines at security checkpoints, and moreover is a mere 10-minute drive from TGen, making traveling to anywhere in the world a breeze.
