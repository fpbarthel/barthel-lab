I have 16 years of genomics wet laboratory experience with a primary focus on 2nd and 3rd generation sequencing for research labs. I’ve worked for two different neurogenomics labs who study the genetics of aging, neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, ALS, FTD), and brain trauma (TBI, CTE, Concussions). More specifically in my current lab, I interrogate the contents of vesicles from non-invasive biofluids (plasma, urine, saliva) and cell culture supernatant as potential indicators of disease status or progression.
