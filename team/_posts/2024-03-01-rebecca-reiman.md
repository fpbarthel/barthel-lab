I have 16 years of genomics wet laboratory experience with a primary focus on 2nd and 3rd generation sequencing for research labs. Iâ€™ve worked for two different neurogenomics labs who study the genetics of aging, neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, ALS, FTD), and brain trauma (TBI, CTE, Concussions).
