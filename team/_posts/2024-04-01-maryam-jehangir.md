As a postdoctoral fellow at Barthel Lab, my research centers on identifying genomic structural rearrangements and variants associated with disease development and genome instability. Before joining this position, my research focused on studying the origin and evolution of supernumerary chromosomes using genome sequencing and assembly techniques.

Outside of my scientific endeavors, I cherish moments with my family, enjoy exploring my passion for cooking, and frequently participate in social and cultural events.
