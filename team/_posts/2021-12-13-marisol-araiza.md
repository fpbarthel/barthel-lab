I am currently a senior at Arizona State University, majoring in Biochemistry. I am interested in precision medicine because it makes it possible for the customization of healthcare for each individual and the choice to avoid expensive treatment that may not be the best course of action for certain patients. As a research intern in Dr. Barthel Lab, I look forward to pursuing this interest by working to investigate the role of telomere dysfunction in gliomas. 

Outside academics, I work in the healthcare field as a CNA. I also enjoy hiking, dancing, and badminton.
