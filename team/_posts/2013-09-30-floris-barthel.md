I am an Assistant Professor at the Cancer and Cell Biology Division at the [Translational Genomics Institute (TGen)](https://www.tgen.org/) and the <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute/research-departments-and-divisions/computational-and-quantitative-medicine">Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine (DCQM)</a> at the <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute">Beckman Research Institute (BRI)</a> at <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/">City of Hope (COH)</a>. I did my postdoc in the laboratory of [Roel Verhaak](https://verhaaklab.com/) at the [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/) and later at the [Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/) where I studied the molecular makeup of glial brain tumors. During these years, I published first-author papers in top-tier journals including *Nature* and *Cell*, and perhaps more importantly, our work played a small part in recent updates to the World Health Organization [guidelines for the classification of brain tumors](https://publications.iarc.fr/Book-And-Report-Series/Who-Classification-Of-Tumours/WHO-Classification-Of-Tumours-Of-The-Central-Nervous-System-2016). 

My ongoing research aims to dissect the role of telomere dysfunction in gliomagenesis using high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis. I will determine the mutational signatures of telomere dysfunction and provide an accurate picture of the role of this process in shaping cancer genomes. Supported by a K99/R00 transitional award from the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) I am funded to interrogate the strategies of telomere maintenance in cancer cells. My recent awards include being named a [Forbeck Scholar](https://www.forbeckforums.org/scholar-award.php) by the [William Guy Forbeck Research Foundation](https://www.wgfrf.org/) and being awarded the [Research Rising Star Award](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/get-involved/celebrating-you-awards/#ResearchRisingStar) by the [Brain Tumor Charity](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/).
