I am a senior at Ironwood High School, attending a professional academy called “The MET Professional Academy” based in the Peoria School District. Attending the MET I have taken a year of Biotechnology, and Human Anatomy and Physiology. During this time, I have developed various skills including Advanced PCR, cell biology, and cell culturing techniques. I am excited to learn and contribute to the Barthel Lab and its work.

My 2 brothers and I were all born and raised here in Arizona, living all throughout the West. Outside of academics, I enjoy bowling, road trips, and bond fires, during the cooler parts of the year. We do have a cat named Lily, she is 3 years old and leaves hair everywhere. One thing that I am passionate about is helping others. I enjoy visiting senior living homes every year, helping serve their Thanksgiving dinners, and having long conversations.
