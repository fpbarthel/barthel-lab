I am currently a student at Arizona State University majoring in Biological Sciences (Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Bio) and minoring in Studio Art. I have a special interest in the use of art in communicating difficult science concepts. Since my sophomore year, I have been an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Susanne Pfeiferâ€™s lab, working on a project investigating recombination rate evolution in rhesus macaques.

I am excited to translate this evolutionary and bioinformatics background towards understanding telomere dysfunction in the Barthel Lab, and I am equally excited to be gaining wet lab experience.

In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, reading, painting, welding, and going to classic car shows.
