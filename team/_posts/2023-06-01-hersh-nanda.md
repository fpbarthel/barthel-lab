I am an undergraduate researcher currently interning in Dr. Floris Barthelâ€™s lab under the 2023 TGen Helios Scholars Program in Phoenix, AZ. My current research focuses on advancing glioblastoma diagnostics using emerging liquid biopsy techniques.

I am currently attending the University of California, Los Angeles as a pre-med student majoring in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. I have always been passionate about scientific research, with a particular interest in cardiovascular medicine. It gives me immense joy to discover new things and solve problems.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming with my dog, hiking with my family, and watching movies.
