I am a pediatric hematology/oncology fellow currently in my second year at Phoenix Childrenâ€™s Hospital. During my dedicated research time with the Barthel Lab, I am completing a translation project analyzing tumor, CSF, and blood samples of our neuro-oncology patients.

I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and spent most of my adult life living in the city where I met my husband. We moved to Phoenix to start my fellowship in June 2023 and welcomed our first daughter this year.  Outside the lab we enjoy being active outdoors, traveling, and trying new recipes.
