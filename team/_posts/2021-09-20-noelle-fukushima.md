Since receiving my BA from UC Santa Cruz and my MS from the University of Utah, I have worked in academic, biotech, pharma, and health care settings doing everything from assay development for diagnostic instruments to high throughput screening of small molecules for drug discovery. I am excited to use these skills to help the Barthel Lab better understand glioma biology.

I grew up in New Mexico but have lived all over the western part of the country.  My husband is a biology professor at ASU.  We have two middle school aged kids and a 15 lb brown dog named Tango.  We love the outdoors and spend our free time hiking, biking, and exploring our public lands.
