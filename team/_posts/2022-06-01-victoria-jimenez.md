I am currently a junior at the University of Southern California, majoring in biomedical engineering with an electrical emphasis. On campus I am involved in engineering organizations such as Women in Engineering, as well as coding programs to integrate in my studies. Currently, I am working on my scribe certification and EMT license, with plans to attend medical school after my undergraduate studies. My goal is to pursue a career combining engineering and medicine to study Alzheimer’s, as well as other diseases.

Over the past couple years, I have been involved in gene sequencing bioinformatics as well as research in neural modulation to study memory and learning in rodents. In these research opportunities I have assisted in published articles and have completed my animal training to work with animals in research. 

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and spending time exploring Los Angeles. I’m also interested in yoga and finding fun ways to exercise.
