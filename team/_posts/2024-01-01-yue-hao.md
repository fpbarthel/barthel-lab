I am a computational scientist in both Floris Barthel lab and Michael Berens lab at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. I specialize in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, also structural variation detection with long-read data. Previously, I was a postdoc in Michael Lynch lab at the Center for Mechanisms of Evolution, ASU Biodesign Institute where I worked on de novo assembly of both Daphnia and Paramecium genomes using PacBio HiFi data, and population genomics of Paramecium.

My research interests span from polyploid genomes to cancer evolution. My goal is to study the immune landscape and heterogeneity of glioblastoma through the lens of evolution and to find the signatures of vulnerability in GBM through investigation of structural variation in cancer genomes.

Outside the lab, I enjoy petting my three cats, listening to classical music, playing the piano, dancing, reading, painting, playing Minecraft and various board games.
