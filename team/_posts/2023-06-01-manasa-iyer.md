I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a B.S. in Biological Sciences, minor in Business, and certificate in Evolutionary Medicine presently working towards earning my M.S. in Molecular & Cellular Biology at the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center. My research interests lie at the intersection of evolutionary theory, cancer biology, and bioinformatics, and I am excited to further explore these disciplines through investigating the role of telomere dysfunction in glioma evolution at the Barthel Lab.

As an aspiring physician, Iâ€™m passionate about gaining an interdisciplinary understanding of translational research and precision medicine, with the ultimate intent of improving the quality-of-life outcomes of diverse populations afflicted with complex diseases.

Having grown up in Arizona, I enjoy serving the Greater Phoenix Area through a variety of volunteer, clinical, community outreach, and mentorship roles. In my free time, I love long-distance running, reading just about anything, and exploring everything Arizona has to offer!
