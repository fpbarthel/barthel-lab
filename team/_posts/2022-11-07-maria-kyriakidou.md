I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Floris Barthel, at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. My previous training includes whole genome assembly and detection of structural variants using Next and Third Generation Sequencing data, analysis of ChIP-and RNA-sequencing data in plants and in cancer.

My research interests include the integration of multiple omics data. During my free time, I enjoy running, hiking and baking.
