My current research interest is the detection of telomere dysfunction from DNA sequencing. I am developing algorithms to dissect signatures of telomere dysfunction from both long and short telomeric reads which contain highly repetitive sequences. I have received my bachelorâ€™s in engineering from Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India, and my doctorate related to computational science from the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Subsequently, I received postdoctoral research experience from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. During both my doctoral study and postdoctoral appointment, I gained experience in algorithm development, parallel computation, code verification & validation, optimization, and mathematical modeling which I am using in my current project.

Apart from academic research, I enjoy reading about new technologies and the global economy. I also have an interest in music, arts, and photography.
