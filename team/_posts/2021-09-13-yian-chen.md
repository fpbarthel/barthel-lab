I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Floris Barthel at The Translational Genomics Research Institute. I did my previous postdoc in the Lab of Chia-Lin Wei at The Jackson Laboratory where I studied 3D Genomic in Cancers. During these years, I have learned various NGS technologies.

My current research project is defining the regulatory landscape of functional and dysfunctional telomeric chromatin interactions. This project will use Telomere-C to address how telomere interaction shapes transcription.

In addition to science, I'm interested in music (from classic to modern), Karate, Pingpong, and DIY car maintenance.
