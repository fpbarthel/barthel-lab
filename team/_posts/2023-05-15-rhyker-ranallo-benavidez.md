As a computational scientist in the Floris Barthel lab at the Translational Genomics Research Institute, I am investigating how telomere dysfunction contributes to the formation of structural variants in glioblastoma. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte where I developed bioinformatics pipelines to detect structural variants from long read sequencing data in Drosophila populations.

My research interests include algorithm development and optimization, reproducibility, long read sequencing analysis, and structural variant detection.

In my free time I enjoy playing Pokemon Go with my husband and daughter.
