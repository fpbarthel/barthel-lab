I am a PhD student at the Molecular and Cellular Biology program at Arizona State University. I graduated from Rutgers University – New Brunswick with a double major in Biological Sciences and Psychology in May 2020. My previous research at the Pierce Lab at the Brain Health Institute in Piscataway NJ studied the neuronal and epigenetic mechanisms behind prolonged psychostimulant use.

I’m looking forward to exploring a different field of neuroscience and learning more about telomere dysfunction in gliomagenesis at the Barthel Lab.

Outside of the classroom and the lab, I like to use my free time to paint, read and spend time with family and friends. Having lived in New Jersey for most of my life, I hope to explore the west coast more over the next few years.
